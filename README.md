# Hardest Game 3D

Unity Android game released for the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Olbrieno.HardestGame3D).

I was wondering what would the [World's Hardest Game](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game) look in 3D, so I decided to make one.\
It follows the same basic concept of the original game, avoid obstacles and reach the end but with a few diferences.

It is a full released playable game with ads, music and menu.\
Game was made completely inside Unity from the objects to the GUI.

It has 20 original levels with difficulty ranging from hard to really hard (not supposed to be an easy game).\
You have to collect all Yellow "coins" and reach the end without dying.

It stores the number of deaths you had at that level.\
Music by [[friendzoned]](https://soundcloud.com/friendzonedbeats).
Effects made using the software Reaper and my guitar.
It also has 3 different types of controllers, from "pressing" to "joystick".

You can download the game from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Olbrieno.HardestGame3D).

Can you beat the game?
